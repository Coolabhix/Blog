					<p>Ahh Bristle Bots!<br> What are they? Well A bristlebot or brushbot is an extremely simple form of walking robot. It is one of the simplest of all mobile robots, both in its function and its construction. As a result of this ease of construction, they have become popular projects at the school science fair level. They dont require any maintainence and eat very little food(batteries).<br><h3>Components</h3>
						Ive made many types of Bristle Bots using a shoe brush, a cloth washing brush and some toothbrush heads.
					All you need to make a bristleBot is a toothbrush head, a vibrating motor, and a battery<br>
					The total cost of making a bristle bot is about 20rs. But having a bristle bot is <em>priceless!</em></p>

					<p>
						This Trip Wire / Door alarm system is useful in guarding doors against unwanted visitors and if you want to trap anyone then you can extend the wire and use it as a tripwire.
						<br><br><h3>Components</h3>
						The components which I used are : A 9v Battery, A clothes hanging clip, a 6v Buzzer and a LED strip.

					<p>
						Woah, That's a lot of stuff!<br>
						"Hmm I dont have a table lamp... and its pretty expensive to buy one.
						so lets just make one!"<br>
						Thats where I got the idea from. A table lamp, a fan which can be powered through a phone , a laptop or a power bank( Dont want to use your device's battery? Well I've added a 9v battery for backup too! ), A pen stand <em>and</em> a bluetooth speaker. What else can you want?<br><br><h3>Components</h3>
						Components I used : An old Popcorn box as the pen stand, A selfie stick acting as the lamp stand, two big white LEDs, a 9v Battery, A toggle switch for the lamp, a Normal switch for the fan, A 9v DC motor(Thank you Sonal didi) and an old usb cable cut and attached to the DC motor for supporting various devices.

						Pimp my ride!
						looks cool right? 0% buying 100% making!<br>
						Everything is made from scratch, Even the Bell is made from an old broken cycle bell and a Buzzer. The headlights are made from two Big white LEDs(same ones are used in the table lamp) <br>
						The brake lights are really cool as they only light up when you hit the brakes.<br><br><h3>Components</h3>
						Components I used: Two 9v Batteries, a 12v Buzzer, Two big white LEDs, A green LED strip(to match the theme of my cycle).

					<p>
						These Reading lights can be used not only for reading but can also be used for outdoor adventures at night. <br>
						They are very portable as the lights are installed on a hairclip.
						For bald people I've made a version of it on a hairband too!<br>
						They come really handy a lot of times and can be installed on almost anything.<br><br><h3>Components</h3>
						Components I used : A Hair clip, a small switch, a White 3v LED and a 3.7v battery from an old headphone.

					<p>
						This game is very Easy to make and is a lot of fun!<br>
						I've made it from scrap material lying around in my house.<br>
						In this game you guide your hooked wire through this maze-wire and you have to do it very carefully as if the hook touches the wire the buzzer will Make sound and a Red light will flash indicating "Game over". I've also added some Electricl tape as a Checkpoint. If you touch the wire, you have to start again.
						<br><br><h3>Components</h3>
						Components I used: A wooden piece as the base, A Clothes hanger as the maze, a 9v Battery, a Red LED, a 5v Buzzer(Thank you Sonal didi), and a switch.
